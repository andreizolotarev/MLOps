# Pipelines

If you're a DS you should've heard or even tried the sklearn pipelines. Although Sklearn pipelines implementation is great, but for complex real-world ML pipelines it won't be enough. Previously I've used two libraries to build pipelines: Luigi and Airflow. 

Here I will add two examples with Luigi and Airflow.
In the first example (Luigi) I will create a pipeline for automatic ticker downloading and plot creation.
